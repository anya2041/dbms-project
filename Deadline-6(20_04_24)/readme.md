## TO DO
Write and execute db transactions(including conflicting ones) and check the effect on your db.


Since this is the final deadline for your projects, you have to complete all the work you have done in the previous deadlines in order to provide the end-to-end application that you proposed initially.

Requirements:

. A document containing the transactions you have covered. Make at least 4 non-conflicting transactions and 2 conflicting transactions.
.A user interface to showcase the working of your project(CLI would work)
.A user guide that contains all the features and their working.
