## TO DO
You need to design a conceptual model, i.e. ER diagram, and a corresponding Relational model for the project scope that you have defined in your previous submission, and submit it in a single pdf. You should not submit pictures of diagrams created with pen/pencil on a piece of paper. Please keep in mind that the design, requirements and constraints that you define in your first two submissions need to be fully implemented in your subsequent submissions.
